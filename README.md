HealthConnect MedKick: Automated Patient Care and Management System
HealthConnect MedKick is an innovative solution designed to automate various aspects of patient care and management. This README outlines the components of the system, the technology stack used, and future development plans.

Components
1. Nurse-Patient Audio Call Transcription
Current Implementation:

Model Loading: Utilizes the pre-trained Wav2Vec2 processor and model from "facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h" for audio input processing and predictions.
Audio Processing: Employs the librosa library for audio file loading and noisereduce for noise reduction to enhance input audio quality.
Transcription: Processes audio with Wav2Vec2 to encode and decode, converting audio to text transcription.
Future Plans:

Fine-tuning Wav2Vec2 Model: Leveraging Hugging Face Transformers for custom dataset training.
Conformer Model Architecture: Transitioning to Conformer architecture for improved transcription accuracy.
Training and Inference: Adapting the training process for the Conformer model to enhance audio transcription capabilities.
2. Secure Communication via BB84 Quantum Protocol
Implementation Overview:

Establishes a secure communication channel using BB84 protocol for quantum encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of nurse-patient conversations and the protection of sensitive medical information.
3. Redaction of Personal Information
Current Implementation:

SpaCy NLP Model: Utilizes "en_core_web_md" for named entity recognition (NER) to identify and redact personal information from transcriptions.
Future Plans:

Integrate redaction into the workflow for transcribed nurse-patient calls, applying NER for comprehensive data protection.
4. Transcript Summary for Doctors
Development Steps:

Utilizes the PegasusForConditionalGeneration model for summarizing transcriptions, providing concise reports for doctors.
Future Development:

Plan to run and fine-tune the model on powerful systems with custom datasets for tailored summary generation.
5. Patient Note Report Generation
Implementation Details:

Uses the AlpaCare LLM, fine-tuned on local datasets, to generate patient-specific notes including medications and precautions.
6. Calendar Scheduling via Federated Learning
Proposed Approach:

Implement federated learning to dynamically generate an optimized scheduling calendar based on inputs from various hospital devices, maintaining privacy and security.
7. Dashboard Portal for Hospital Staff and Doctors
Development Plan:

Framework: Combining Flask and Django for secure dashboard creation and user management.
Integration: Incorporates federated learning for scheduling and provides access to patient summaries, medical records, and resources.
