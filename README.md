# HealthConnect MedKick: Automated Patient Care and Management System

This project leverages state-of-the-art NLP models to transcribe audio calls between patients and nurses, redact sensitive information, summarize key details, and generate tailored reports for patients and doctors. It also explores integrating quantum cryptography for securing data transfers and federated learning techniques for privacy-preserving predictive analytics.

### Features
Audio call transcription powered by the Wav2Vec2 model, with options to fine-tune on custom datasets
Automatic redaction of personal information using SpaCy and regex
Scientific article summarization using the Pegasus model from Hugging Face
Patient and doctor report generation with the AlpaCare LLM
Quantum encryption implementation with BB84 protocol and Qiskit
Federated learning simulation for secure and decentralized analytics
Flask and Django dashboard with pagination, user authentication, literature recommendations, and more
